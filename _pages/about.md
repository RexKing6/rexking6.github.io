*[^_^]: title: "About [中文](http://rexking6.top/about_cn)"

Hi! I’m Run-Qing Chen, an AIOps algorithm developer at Alibaba Cloud. My expertise lies in Root Cause Analysis, where I pinpoint the heart of IT issues. I also craft predictive models for failure anticipation and develop anomaly detection systems to spot irregular patterns. Additionally, I work on Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Large Language Models to enhance AI's capabilities. I'm passionate about leveraging AI to make IT operations more efficient and proactive.

I received my Master degree on Computer Science and Technology in Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Informatics, Xiamen University in Jul. 2021 supervised by [Dr. Wan-Lei Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ECnpPEAAAAJ).  During that period, My research focus were Anomaly Detection and Matrix Profile.

I received my Bachelor degree on Information and Computing Science from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in Jul. 2018 supervised by [Dr. Song-Song Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Songsong_Wu). During that period, My research focus was Zero-shot Learning.
